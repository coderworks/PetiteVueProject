# PetiteVueProject

### Welcome to Savegame Navigator

This tool is created to explore savegame data of an old game named 'Project Nomads'.
Savegames created during gameplay are text based and have parameters to tinker around with.
Savegames can be loaded in this tool for navigating the data.
The project is created to test en further develop my front-end skills, 
and to translate vehicle coordinates to a graph which is fun since as a character in 
a game you're immersed. With data shown in the graph you can see from the outside looking in 
what's normally all around you.

### Tool features are:
<ul>
    <li>🚣 Loading savegame file(s) for required data</li>
    <li>Loaded files are stored in browser storage</li>
    <li>🐛 View different clans from provided savegame</li>
    <li>🌪 Surf through the parameters</li>
    <li>🚢 Check out vehicle parameters</li>
    <li>🧭 View vehicle coordinates in a chart</li>
    <li>🖊️ Edit data</li>
</ul>
And more components and options could be added...

### This tool is created with:
<ul>
    <li>Petite-Vue for no NPM overhead in development</li>
    <li>Lodash for ease of object handling</li>
    <li>Plotly which is terribly slow but easy to implement</li>
    <li>CSS with responsiveness in mind</li>
</ul>
